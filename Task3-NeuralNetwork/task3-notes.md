# Data Prep:
    - Train test split of 9:1

# Designing Algorithms:
    
## Neural Network:
    - Need to design a neural network for classifying patients as patient or control based on [].
    - Fully connected nn architecture with two hidden layers.
        - hidden layers [500 neurons] -> sigmoid activation
        - output layer [1 neuron] -> sigmoid activation
    - 

## Descision Tree:
    - 

## Tasks for the things:
    - Use 10 fold CV method to choose the best number of neurons or number of trees for ANN and random forests
        - Report the processes involved when applying CV.
        - Report the mean accuracy results for each set of params.
        - Which parameters should we use for each of the two methods.
    - Eval
        - Which method is the best
        - Discuss and justify your choice.
